# Brain MRI Sample Dataset

Data sourced from the [Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD)](http://medicaldecathlon.com/) dataset. Sampled dataset was curated by first extracting the volume data from the original NifTI format, a middle slice (index 75) across all samples was chosen, and then stored as `npy` format. All samples are stored as arrays with 64-bit float precision.
