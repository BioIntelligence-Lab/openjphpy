# Chest X-Ray Sample Dataset

Data sourced from the [NIH Chest X-Ray 14](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02315) dataset. Sampled dataset was curated by first extracting the image data from the original PNG format and then stored as `npy` format. All samples are stored as arrays with 8-bit unsigned integer precision.
